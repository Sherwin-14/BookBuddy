# BookBuddy: Your Flask Library API

BookBuddy is a RESTful API built with Flask, designed to manage books in a library. It provides a robust platform for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a database of books.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Manage your library with ease. Add new books, read book details, update book information, or remove books from the collection.
- **Book Attributes**: Each book in the database has attributes like title, author, publication date, and genre.

## Future Extensions
- **User Authentication**: Secure your library by allowing only authenticated users to perform operations.
- **Book Reviews and Ratings**: Let users rate books and write reviews.
- **Recommendation System**: Recommend books to users based on their preferences.
- **External Book APIs**: Integrate with external book APIs for expanded information.

This project showcases skills in Flask, API development, and database management. It's your buddy in managing books!
